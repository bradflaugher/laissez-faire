# Laissez Faire

## A Grand Strategy Game Engine

Welcome to **Laissez Faire**, a zero-to-one player grand strategy game engine inspired by Paradox Interactive titles like *Europa Universalis*. This project aims to create a flexible and powerful engine that can be used to simulate a wide range of scenarios, from modern warfare to historical events.

The core of Laissez Faire is a text-based interface that allows you to interact with the game using natural language. Instead of micromanaging units and resources, you will develop high-level strategies and see how they play out in a dynamic and realistic world.

## Key Features

*   **LLM-Powered Decision Making:** The game is driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) that control the actions of non-player characters, creating a challenging and unpredictable experience.
*   **Flexible Scenarios:** Scenarios are defined in JSON files, making it easy to create and share your own custom games.
*   **Cross-Platform:** The engine is being built with cross-platform compatibility in mind, with the goal of running on desktops, mobile devices, and web servers.
*   **Terminal-Based Interface:** The primary interface is a rich terminal UI that can display maps, graphs, and detailed reports.

## Getting Started

_(Instructions to be added)_

## To-Do

*   [ ] Develop the core game engine, including the main game loop and event system.
